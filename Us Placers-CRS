    <h1>Us Placers</h1>
    <h2>Child Rebel Soldier</h2>

    <h3>Intro: Lupe Fiasco</h3>
 <p>
    Yeah, just a little bit<br>
    Just a little bit<br>
    And it goes...<br>
</p>

    <h3> Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco</h3>
<p>
        Lifestyles of the rich and famous<br>
        Bought a big house and a whole lot of Ranges<br>
        A fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers<br>
        A closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers<br>
        And, some Mexican floral arrangers<br>
        A great big TV that'll entertain us<br>
        Some colorful commissions from some high-paid painters<br>
        Someone to take the rap so that I stay stainless<br>
        And, a new relationship with a banker<br>
        And two pinky rings for my manicured fingers<br>
        A trained German Shepherd that bark when it's angered<br>
        To watch my possessions and look out for strangers<br>
        And, a fifty-foot yacht with an anchor<br>
        A young supermodel that shall remain nameless<br>
        Ups and the downs, the sames and the changes<br>
        All the money in the world don't make it painless, no<br>

    <h3>Chorus: Lupe Fiasco</h3>
<p>      <section>
        But they love it, and they love it, the more<br>
        The more you try to erase me<br>
        And they love it, and they love it<br>
        The more, the more<br>
        And they love it, and they love it, the more<br>
        The more that I appear, oh<br>
        Ugh, and they love it, and they love it<br>
        The more, the more<br>
        And they love it and they love it the more<br>
        The more you try the eraser<br>
        And they love it and they love it<br>
        The more, the more<br>
        And they love it and they love it the more<br>
        The more that you appear<br>

    <h3>Verse 2: Kanye West</h3>
<p>
        Plain Pat, what up?
        Ugh, ugh, lifestyles of the broke and famous
        Let you know how crazy this game is
        Look at all the new, beautiful faces
        At home, supermodel MySpaces
        Long for they shot on the TV screens
        American Idol never seen these dreams
        Just last week, they want to see ID
        Now, they got you in V.I.P., huh?
        How many people almost famous?
        You almost remember what they name is
        Like "Hey, didn't you play in?... no, it couldn't be, quit playin'"
        And tryna keep that balance after MTV
        That's a Real World Challenge
        Back on that train
        Never to be heard from again

    <h3>Chorus: Lupe Fiasco</h3>
<p>      <section>
        But they love it, and they love it, the more<br>
        The more you try to erase me<br>
        And they love it, and they love it<br>
        The more, the more<br>
        And they love it, and they love it, the more<br>
        The more that I appear, oh<br>
        Ugh, and they love it, and they love it<br>
        The more, the more<br>
        And they love it and they love it the more<br>
        The more you try the eraser<br>

    <h3>Verse 3: Pharrell Williams</h3>
<p>      <section>
         G-R-I-P, P-I-M-P
        I, any spelling, snitch, come on, that's me<br>
        I bring a burning sensation to the urban eye<br>
        Like an eye-drop of turpentine<br>
        You can listen to the serpent, fine<br>
        But the earth got gas; once it burps, it's fine<br>
        Some around me, they talk about degrees<br>
        Not GHG, how to cook a quarter key (Ugh)<br>
        Talking all nasal, he ain't over that cold<br>
        No glove, scrub, man, he just over that stove<br>
        Perfect paradigm, wrong place, wrong time<br>
        Should have been Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline<br>
        Number one chemist, look at him, no blemish<br>
        Eggshell off-white like a DuPont finish<br>
        Young, dumb, high-strung, who could handle us?<br>
        I wonder how God's gon' paint todays canvases<br>
        'Cause who knew that day that man would just<br>
        Go to V.A. with a Tec and spray campuses?<br>
        What a way to see the cover of Time<br>
        I know that ninja wish he was standing in line<br>

    <h3>Chorus: Lupe Fiasco, Thom Yorke, & Pharell Williams</h3>

<p>      <section>
        But they love it, and they love it, the more (To see it)<br>
         
        The more you try to erase me (As if he didn't do it)<br> 
        And they love it, and they love it<br> 
        The more, the more<br> 
        And they love it, and they love it, the more<br> 
        The more that I appear, oh<br> 
        Ugh, and they love it, and they love it<br> 
        The more, the more<br> 
        And they love it and they love it the more<br> 
        The more you try the eraser<br> 
        And they love it and they love it<br> 
        The more, the more<br> 
        And they love it and they love it the more<br> 
        The more that you appear <br>
